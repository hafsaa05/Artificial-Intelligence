## Steps to Solve a Genetic Algorithm (GA) Problem:

1. *Problem Definition*
   - Identify the objective function (fitness function).
   - Define the solution space (e.g., binary strings, real numbers).
   - Determine constraints and boundaries for valid solutions.

2. *Configuration*
   - Choose population size (e.g., 20, 50).
   - Set mutation rate (e.g., 0.1 for 10% chance of mutation).
   - Set the number of generations to run (e.g., 50).
   - Define chromosome structure (e.g., 6-bit strings for values 0-31).

3. *Fitness Function*
   - Design a function to evaluate the quality of a solution.
   - Higher fitness values indicate better solutions (unless minimizing).

4. *Population Initialization*
   - Generate a random population of individuals (chromosomes).
   - Each individual must follow the defined solution space format.

5. *Parents Selection*
   - choose 50% population
   - Use methods like:
     - *Tournament Selection* → Select k individuals, choose the best.
     - *Roulette Wheel Selection* → Probability-based selection.
     - *Rank Selection* → Individuals are ranked, and better ranks get higher chances.

7. *Crossover (Recombination)*
   - Combine genes from two parents to create offspring.
   - Common methods include:
     - *Single-point crossover* → Split parents at a random point.
     - *Uniform crossover* → Each gene is randomly chosen from either parent.

8. *Mutation*
   - Randomly flip bits (binary) or adjust values (real-valued).
   - Helps prevent convergence to local optima.

9. *Termination Condition*
   - Stop when:
     - Maximum generations reached.
     - A solution meets a defined fitness threshold.

10. *Final Output*
   - Return the best solution found.
   - Display relevant information like fitness value and solution details.
