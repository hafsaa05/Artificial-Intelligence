'''
A rescue robot is deployed in a grid-based environment to locate and rescue a lost individual.
The terrain consists of different types of obstacles:

O; represents open paths that can be traversed.
X; represents obstacles that cannot be crossed.
P; represents the starting position of the robot.
T; represents the target location where the lost individual is located.
The robot can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
implement Depth-First Search (DFS) find a path from P to T
